# IoT Smart Agriculture System

## Project Overview

The IoT Smart Agriculture System integrates modern IoT technologies with agriculture, utilizing a Raspberry Pi 5, DS18B20 temperature sensor, and a capacitive moisture sensor with an MCP3008 ADC. The system collects real-time data on soil moisture and temperature, transmitting it to AWS IoT Core and ThingSpeak for analysis and visualization. This project aims to optimize resource usage and provide actionable insights for sustainable farming.

## Code Repositories

- **Frontend Repository**: [Smart Agri Frontend](https://github.com/Fullstack-Alchemists-SJSU/smart_agri_frontend)
- **Backend Repository**: [Smart Agri Backend](https://github.com/Fullstack-Alchemists-SJSU/smart_agri_backend)

## Setup Instructions

### Hardware Setup

1. Assemble the Raspberry Pi 5 with the DS18B20 temperature sensor and the capacitive moisture sensor.
2. Connect the MCP3008 ADC to the Raspberry Pi for analog-to-digital conversion.
3. Calibrate sensors using dry and saturated soil samples for accurate readings.
